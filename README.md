# Bharath-Intern
as a intern i have completed first task that is predicting the house price.

This repository contains the code and resources for my House Price Prediction project completed during my internship at Bharath Intern.

Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

Thousands of houses are sold everyday. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house deserves? Am I paying a fair price?
Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the home prices in India. We are going to use the dataset from Kaggle.com.
The model is trained on a dataset containing the dataset in the kaagle. 
The primary goal is to provide accurate predictions for real estate pricing.

Provide insights into the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or any relevant metrics. Include visualizations if applicable.
